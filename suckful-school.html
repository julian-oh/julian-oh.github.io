RANT #1
Do you learn enough things for the time you spend (waste) on schools?

Recently, I've been more involved in programming because of my school but not in the way you expect. 
The reason I've been getting into the programming again is because of the social rewards I am getting from it.
I have some (really great) friends that are interested in programming as I am (atleast one of them are more enthusiastic about it), but you don't care about that!
So I'll get into the point quick, because of the motivation I am getting from my friends and all, I've been more social and interactive towards my other classmates. 

---- draft 2 -----

So I've been getting into programming lately because of few good friends (in school) and it was fun and all. Since I have good friends now I've been more interactive with people and more confident.
I can help and talk to people more than before (self esteem).  I can confidently help the people who are troubled in our Computer Programming class<a href="#meme">*</a>. 
There's a very nice girl in our class whose name is Jasmine, she is a very diligent girl and very eager to learn, she's probably the only one who learn from our very terrible (((teacher))) in Maths. 
I kinda shared my knowledge upon her and taught her about the ***literal*** basics of a computer language (in this case, (((TURBO FUCKING C++))). She seemed like she learned alot based from her reaction when
I tried making her understand about the basic syntax and data types (statements, strings (char*) etc...) and she seemed to understand and I felt happy about it. She also expressed her awe because """I know alot""" (I probably don't).
I hope she did truly understand it because you know... it's really the first thing everyone should know before they can actually learn programming, reading and writing.

[ talk more on how kind-of incorrectly organized the teaching path is, and please for pete's sake, try to be less condecending ]

I've been observing our Computer Programming teacher, although cool and nice, I don't think he's really connected on what true beginners should learn in a programming language.

Okay SO--- I THINK THIS IS THE CURICULLUM AND IT'S VERY STUPID: 
The normie soy-devs thinks that it's *cools* and *awesomes* to teach this stupid thing called flowcharts. That's memery upon the highest level my dude.
I learned the basics of programming through the feedback I'm getting from my little <a href="">ModPE Scripts</a>, and understood them deeply because of results that's infront of my face.
I did try telling our teacher that he should use a projector (or use the (((wireless))) TV) and demonstrate his lessons instead of (futilely) explain it on a chalkboard.
(fun fact, it's really hard to learn programming in a chalk board), I hope he remembers and follow through.

[ talk about how meme-y the F L O W charts are, atleast how they shouldn't be what to be taught in the first, in theory it should work but it really doesn't
it's basically teaching beginners how the structure of programming is without even knowing what in the hell programming actually is, suggestion, try to make them first
and then tell later, (Show don't tell, -Jesus)]

tl;dr - We don't actually learn much from schools and it's just the retarded system that's forcing retarded kids to go to it so they can earn a diploma and heaven's forbid, get a job.
(SPOILER: My sister didn't bothered going to college, she spends her time on the ministry, she's married, although she's not that rich, she a very simple life (which what you NPCs should be aiming your life to be) 
and she's really happy. She have a part-time job (Uber, although she doesn't really stay much on a single job) and she even sends money here. so yeah..., that's basically all a lie
infact I can guarantee you that most of the things the media, goverment, college graduates, stressed moms, a.k.a the 'system' tells you are 98% lies, you can infact survive healthly by eating only MEAT)

[ make this more clear and relevant, infact, do this to everything about this mess ]

[ be more concise ]
<meme> COMPUTER PROGRAMMING CLASSES ARE A MEME, I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS ALSO TRUE IN COM-SCI CLASSES BUT WHAT THE HELL, THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA!!
THE PERSON WHO THOUGHT OF THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR SOMEONE TO TEACH AN ENTIRE CLASS HOW TO COMPUTER IS NOT REALLY SMART (A PERSON SINGLEHANDEDLY TEACHING A BUNCH OF PUPILS IS ALSO A MEME).
I DO LEARN SOMETHING, BUT I THINK I'D LEARN 1000% MORE IF I DID ON MY OWN SERIOUSLY! MY CLASS LITERALLY BARELY HAD ANY IDEA HOW TO PROGRAM.
